# CapstoneProject

A snapshot of part of the project I worked on for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program certification.
Unfortunately, I messed up the repository at one point, and wanted to lose the nested nature of "AnyoneCanFish" residing
within a "CapstoneProject" directory, and the easiest way I knew to do that (not a Git master...) was to create a separate
repository after moving it to a new directory.

I am not working on this code base.
